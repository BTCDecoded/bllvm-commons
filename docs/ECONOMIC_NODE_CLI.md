- **Zap tracking**: Zaps are tracked for transparency/reporting, but don't affect governance decisions
- **No economic nodes**: No special privileges for mining pools, exchanges, or custodians

## Historical Information (Deprecated)

The following information describes the old economic node system that has been removed:

### Old System Overview

The economic node system allowed mining pools, exchanges, and custodians to participate in governance by:
- Registering with proof of their economic stake
- Submitting veto signals for Tier 3+ changes
- Verifying the integrity of the governance system

**This system is no longer active.**
